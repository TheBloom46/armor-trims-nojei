Armor Trims allows you to decorate your armor with gems and ores (and dusts and crushed ores and whatever else you define in the config).<br>
<br>
When you open the GUI, you may see something like this:<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hipposgrumm/armor-trims/master/images/guiShow.png" alt="Smithing GUI featuring base input slot, additional input/template input slot, material input slot, and output slot. There is also an armor stand."><br>
If you don't see the third slot at first, don't panic. That's by design. It will only appear once you have placed a smithing template in the second slot.<br>
This doesn't change how default recipes work. They will still work like regular recipes, except for netherite recipes, which are disabled (by default, but can be re-enabled in the config).<br>
<br>
This mod will of course allow you to trim your armor for everyone to see!

I didn't just stop there though. I also made it so that the trim will also render on the item!

This is the survivor's toolkit. This text that almost no-one will see (unless they use inspect element or actually need a screen reader) is also very long."><br>
<br>
This mod is also <i>super</i> configurable.
